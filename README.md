### Web Scaping Project
In this project I gathered information from job openings from [Time Jobs](https://www.timesjobs.com/) where you can filter skills, company, and times of the posted date.

### Functionality 
- Filters out skills you're unfamiliar with and finds job openings without those skills
- Finds related job postings in a "few" day time spand
- Gets the company name, the required skills, and the job posting link for that specific job
- After the previous lines above, it stores the openings into a [Posts Folder](/Users/andrewfarrell/Desktop/Road2Developer/WebScraping/posts/) and stores them as .txt files
- Finally, it waits 10 minutes before finding more openings 

### Special Thanks
